# Date Spot
1. Project Overview
- **Date Spot **is a dating platform/application inspired by conversations between** Mia and Mai**, two single friends navigating the challenges of finding emotionally available partners in the fast-paced environment of Brooklyn. After experiencing emotional burnout from the typical online dating experience, they came up with the idea for date spot. Their goal is to create a solution that addresses the prevalent issues in modern dating culture, including overwhelming choices, catfishing, ghosting, and more.
