                <strong>1. Respect and Kindness</strong><br />
                Treat all dates with respect and kindness, regardless of whether or not there is a romantic interest.
                Value the other person’s time and feelings. If you're not interested, communicate politely and respectfully.<br /><br/>

                <strong>2. Honesty and Transparency</strong><br />
                Be honest about your intentions and what you're looking for in dating (e.g., a casual connection, long-term relationship, etc.).
                Avoid misleading others about your interests, intentions, or availability. Transparency helps foster trust and a positive experience.<br /><br />

                <strong>3. Clear Communication</strong><br />
                Practice open and clear communication, especially regarding plans, expectations, and boundaries.
                Communicate if you’re running late, need to reschedule, or feel uncomfortable at any point.<br /><br />

                <strong>4. Consent and Boundaries</strong><br />
                Always ask for and respect boundaries—both physical and emotional. Be mindful of the other person’s comfort level. If they express discomfort or ask you to stop any behavior, immediately respect their wishes.
                Understand that consent can be withdrawn at any time.<br /><br />

                <strong>5. Personal Safety</strong><br />
                Prioritize both your safety and the other person’s. If meeting for the first time, consider choosing a public place.
                Avoid sharing personal information (like your address) too early.
                Be understanding if the other person also wants to maintain a level of privacy early on.<br /><br />

                <strong>6. Accountability</strong><br />
                Take responsibility for your actions and words. Apologize if you’ve made a mistake or overstepped a boundary.
                Avoid making empty promises or commitments that you can’t follow through on.<br /><br />

                <strong>7. No Harassment or Aggression</strong><br />
                Harassment, aggressive behavior, or pressure for physical intimacy will not be tolerated. Respect the other person’s autonomy and decisions.
                Refrain from using language or gestures that could make someone feel uncomfortable or threatened.<br />
